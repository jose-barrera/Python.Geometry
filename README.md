# Geometry

This project implements 4 classes representing geometric objects into 2D cartesian space. 

OOP fundamental principles are illustrated in all of the classes (abstraction, encapsulation).

The classes are:
* Point
* Circle
* Ellipse
* RegularHeptagon

Each class has its UML class diagram inside the source code.

Notes:
1. *The implementations are not exhaustive.*
2. *These examples are oriented to college students learning Object-Oriented Paradigm.*
3. *Anyone is welcomed to improve these examples of OOP programming with good practices.*
4. *This project is also implemented in C++, Java, and C# for comparative purposes.*
